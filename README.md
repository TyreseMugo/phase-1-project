Welcome to the Meal Description Hub! This is an application that allows users to explore various meal categories and view detailed descriptions and images for each meal. These detailed descriptions and images were fetched from an API that dealt with food specifically and was able to provide us with all the information. Users can also vote for their favorite dishes using the vote button. 

## Files used

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS


## Features

- Fetches data from an external API to display meal categories and descriptions.
- Allows users to vote for their favorite dishes.
- Displays images for each meal category.
- The styling is done to resemble some sort of a Brochure or Menu. 

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. You should be able to browse through the different meal categories and read the descriptions.
3. Vote for your favorite dishes by clicking the "Vote for Dish" button.
(You should be able to see the vote count increasing everytime you tap on the "Vote for Dish" button.)

## How to Run the Application

- Open the live server through the HTML document and it should be able to direct you to your web browser. 
- Then after, you should be able to see the document, which features the display of the different meals and their descriptions.
